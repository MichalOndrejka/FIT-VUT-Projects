# CHANGELOG

This program creates a UDP or TCP client that sends a message from STDIN to a server and receives a response. The program reads arguments from the command line to determine the hostname, port number, and mode (UDP or TCP).\

## Known bugs:
 - Client doesn't validate expressions
 - Buffer for input and output is not dynamically allocated
