### Testing:
Testing was done on NixOS in C Developer enviroment provide by the course. I tested based functionality as well as edge cases, multiple parameters and different ports.
First I started the program with specific command line arguments, then I pinged different packets using sudo nping \[protocol\] \[port\] \[address\]
